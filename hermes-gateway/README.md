# Hermes Gateway 1.0.3 Test

Runs [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)'s
messaging gateway (`hermes gateway run`): Telegram, Discord, Slack,
WhatsApp, Email, the built-in cron scheduler, and (optionally) an
OpenAI-compatible API server for tools like Open WebUI.

This is one of two add-ons in this repository — see the
[repo README](../README.md) for how it relates to `hermes-agent`
(the dashboard/chat side).

## Quick start

1. Install and configure at least one messaging platform's token below
   (or none — the gateway starts and runs the cron scheduler either way,
   it just won't have anywhere to talk yet).
2. Start the add-on.
3. Check the log for `✓ <platform> connected` (or `✗ <platform> failed`
   if a token is wrong).

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openrouter_api_key` | password | *(empty)* | Model provider — see hermes's own `hermes model`/`hermes setup` for other providers; this add-on only wires up the one env var, others can go through `extra_env`. |
| `telegram_bot_token` | password | *(empty)* | From [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). |
| `telegram_allowed_users` | string | *(empty)* | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs. |
| `discord_bot_token` | password | *(empty)* | |
| `discord_allowed_users` | string | *(empty)* | |
| `slack_bot_token` | password | *(empty)* | `xoxb-...` |
| `slack_app_token` | password | *(empty)* | `xapp-...` (Socket Mode) |
| `slack_allowed_users` | string | *(empty)* | |
| `gateway_allow_all_users` | bool | `false` | Opt-in open access. Leave `false` unless you mean it. |
| `api_server_enabled` | bool | `false` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint on port `8642`. |
| `api_server_key` | password | *(empty)* | **Required if `api_server_enabled` is true** — the add-on refuses to start otherwise (checked before handing off to hermes, with a clear log line). |
| `extra_env` | list of `KEY=VALUE` | `[]` | Escape hatch for the many other integrations hermes supports (WhatsApp, Email, Matrix, Teams, Google Chat, other model providers — see upstream's `.env.example`) that don't have a dedicated option here yet. Malformed entries are logged and skipped, not silently dropped. |
| `config_maintenance_action` | `none\|check\|migrate` | `none` | Fixed-purpose, one-shot maintenance through Hermes's own CLI. `migrate` takes a private `/data/config.yaml` backup first and applies the pinned build's native migration; no arbitrary command or file option exists. |

`migrate` also validates the pinned Gateway resolver and persists only the
approved Telegram toolsets: `memory`, `session_search`, and `todo`. Browser,
computer-use, code execution, file, terminal, delegation, and Home Assistant
toolsets are not selected. The option defaults to `none`, so existing installs
do not write `/data/config.yaml` on restart. Native CLI output is withheld from
the add-on log so configuration values cannot leak.

The pinned runtime automatically introduces `bfl` even with an explicit
platform list. Maintenance records it as declined through the supported
`known_builtin_toolsets.telegram` field, preserving any existing declines.
Both the proposed and saved configuration are checked through the Gateway's
own resolver; an unexpected toolset stops startup before credentials can be used.

### OpenAI-compatible gateways such as 9Router

The pinned Hermes gateway keeps its active model in persistent
`config.yaml`; setting a provider key alone does not change that saved model.
This wrapper therefore treats these non-secret `extra_env` entries as
declarative boot-time model settings as well as runtime overrides:

```yaml
openrouter_api_key: "<gateway client key>"
extra_env:
  - OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=http://your-router:20128/v1
  - HERMES_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=openrouter
  - HERMES_INFERENCE_MODEL=glm/glm-5.3
```

On every start, the wrapper writes the provider, model, and base URL into
Hermes's persisted config before launching the gateway. The API key remains
only in the password-typed Supervisor option/environment and is never copied
into `config.yaml`.

On upgraded installations, an old `/data/.env` may still contain a stale
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...` assignment. Hermes loads that file with override
semantics, so the stale value can otherwise replace the current Supervisor
option. When `openrouter_api_key` is populated, the wrapper removes only that
competing assignment; the current key remains process-environment-only and is
not copied into `.env` or a command argument.

## Ports

`8642/tcp` is declared but **unmapped by default** (`null`) — only relevant
if you turn on `api_server_enabled`. Map it to any host port other than
80/443 (Home Assistant owns those on this host) from the add-on's Network
page if you use it.

## Persistence

All gateway state (config.yaml, sessions, cron jobs, memories, skills,
auth.json) lives under this add-on's `/data`, which Supervisor persists
and backs up automatically.

See [`DOCS.md`](DOCS.md) for the full verification log (exact
`docker build`/`docker run` commands and their real output).
